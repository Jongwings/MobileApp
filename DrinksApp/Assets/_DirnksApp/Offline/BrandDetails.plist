THINGS TO KNOW ABOUT 100% PURE NATURAL FRUIT JUICE
Kids love the taste of pure fruit juice, and parents love it because it’s a healthy source of nutrients. When choosing healthy pure juice for your children, it’s important to note what kind of juice you are serving and how much you are offering. Here’s what families should know about fruit juice versus other fruit-flavoured beverages:

CHOOSE THE RIGHT FRUIT JUICE
All juices are not created equal – some are nutritional gems while others are sugary water. Consider these tips as you make juice part of your family’s diet.

BE LABEL SAVVY
If you are looking to buy 100% fruit juice, ensure it says “100% fruit juice” on the label.

Note that words like “Drink / Fruit Drink” “Punch” “Cocktail” “Beverage” “ade” are not 100% Fruit Juice.
Many “fruit beverages” are nutrient-void beverages, commonly masked as fruit “juice,” “drinks” or “cocktails.” Most contain 10% or less of pure fruit juice, and lots of water, sugar, additives and preservatives. Many fruit beverages have little or no nutritional value.
If you want 100% fruit juice, be sure that’s exactly what you’re getting.</string>

		<string>SIX WAYS TO KEEP FIT AT WORK
Are you in front of a computer all day long? Does your packed schedule leave little time for a workout? There are ways to squeeze in some exercise to get your body in top form even while in the office.

Don’t use the elevator. By taking the stairs, you can easily get your muscles moving, not to mention burn a lot of calories. It’s an inexpensive way to get fit; I actually know someone who uses the stairs to get all the way up to her 16th floor office to lose weight.
Get moving. Why not get water from the farthest dispenser or use the photocopier on the other side of the office? Got to talk to a colleague? Visit his/her cubicle instead of calling her on the intercom.
Sit and stretch. Can’t leave your desk? Do some stretching exercises to relieve yourself of that stiff feeling:
Lift that weight. Get your hands on two reams of A4 paper and use these as you would a pair of dumbbells.
Leg up. Do leg lifts while talking on the phone.
Out to lunch. Go out for a brisk walk instead of driving a car during your lunch break.
Don’t forget, keeping fit allows you to perform your job better.</string>

		<string>THE BENEFITS OF TEA
	•	Tea can boost exercise endurance. Scientists have found that the antioxidants in green tea extract increase the body’s ability to burn fat as fuel, which accounts for improved muscle endurance.
	•	Drinking tea could help reduce the risk of heart attack. Tea might also help protect against cardiovascular and degenerative diseases.
	•	The antioxidants in tea might help protect against a boatload of cancers, including breast, colon, colorectal, skin, lung, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, liver, ovarian, prostate and oral cancers. But don’t rely solely on tea to keep a healthy body — tea is not a miracle cure, after all. While more studies than not suggest that tea has cancer-fighting benefits, the current research is mixed.
	•	Tea helps fight free radicals. Tea is high in Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (“ORAC” to its friends), which is a fancy way of saying that it helps destroy free radicals (which can damage DNA) in the body. While our bodies are designed to fight free radicals on their own, they’re not 100 percent effective — and since damage from these radical oxygen ninjas has been linked to cancer, heart disease and neurological degeneration, we’ll take all the help we can get.
	•	Power of antioxidants: Reverse signs of ageing and fights effects of pollution, reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke, also keeps one hydrated.
	•	Tea is hydrating to the body.</string>
