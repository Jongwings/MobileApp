Does your packed schedule leave little time for a workout? There are ways to squeeze in some exercise to get your body in top form even while in the office.\n\nDon’t use the elevator. By taking the stairs, you can easily get your muscles moving, not to mention burn a lot of calories. It’s an inexpensive way to get fit; I actually know someone who uses the stairs to get all the way up to her 16th floor office to lose weight.\nGet moving. Why not get water from the farthest dispenser or use the photocopier on the other side of the office? Got to talk to a colleague? Visit his/her cubicle instead of calling her on the intercom.\nSit and stretch. Can’t leave your desk? Do some stretching exercises to relieve yourself of that stiff feeling:\nLift that weight. Get your hands on two reams of A4 paper and use these as you would a pair of dumbbells.\nLeg up. Do leg lifts while talking on the phone.\nOut to lunch.

Scientists have found that the antioxidants in green tea extract increase the body’s ability to burn fat as fuel, which accounts for improved muscle endurance.\n\t•\tDrinking tea could help reduce the risk of heart attack. Tea might also help protect against cardiovascular and degenerative diseases.\n\t•\tThe antioxidants in tea might help protect against a boatload of cancers, including breast, colon, colorectal, skin, lung, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, pancreas, liver, ovarian, prostate and oral cancers. But don’t rely solely on tea to keep a healthy body — tea is not a miracle cure, after all. While more studies than not suggest that tea has cancer-fighting benefits, the current research is mixed.\n\t•\tTea helps fight free radicals. Tea is high in Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (“ORAC” to its friends), which is a fancy way of saying that it helps destroy free radicals (which can damage DNA) in the body. While our bodies are designed to fight free radicals on their own, they’re not 100 percent effective — and since damage from these radical oxygen ninjas has been linked to cancer, heart disease and neurological degeneration, we’ll take all the help we can get.\n\t•\tPower of antioxidants: Reverse signs of ageing and fights effects of pollution, reduces the
risk of heart attack and stroke, also keeps one hydrated.\n\t•\tTea is hydrating to the body.","BrandID":"5","BrandThumpImage":"Brand5.png","BrandTitle3":"VARIANTS & INGREDIENTS","BrandTitle2":"REJUVENATION & WELLNESS","BrandDescription1":" Feel the tasty refreshing goodness of Chi Ice Tea.\n\nChi Ice Tea is made from premium natural tea leaves with delicious fruity flavours.
